Python Empyrean API

This is expirimental!

I'm not a Python developer, I think this is going to need binaries to connect properly but maybe not.
I don't even know what I'm talking about but this will happen eventually.

I uploaded some static libs but I don't know if python even uses those.
For it to work perfectly when we make the includes (or python equivalent) it's going to need to work with the C static libraries.
